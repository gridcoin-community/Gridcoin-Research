Gridcoin
=============

Setup
---------------------
Gridcoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency, rewarding BOINC work.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPCoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency. The Gridcoin Client downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Gridcoin transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Gridcoin, visit [gridcoin.us](https://gridcoin.us).
