//! \brief Stores or processes neural network contract messages.
//!
//! Typically, contract handler implementations only mutate the data they store
//! when the application processes contract messages embedded in a transaction.
//! Consumers of the data will usually access it in a read-only fashion because
//! the data is based on immutable values stored in connected blocks.
//!
//! For this reason, contract handlers NEED NOT to implement the interface in a
//! thread-safe manner. The application applies contract messages from only one
//! thread. However, a contract handler MUST guarantee thread-safety for any of
//! its methods that provide the read-only access to the contract data imported
//! by this interface.
