//! \brief The core Gridcoin tally system that processes magnitudes and reward
//! data from the blockchain to calculate earned research reward amounts.

//! This class is designed as a facade that provides an interface for the rest
//! of the application. It consumes information from newly-connected blocks to
//! build a database of research reward context for each CPID in the network.
//!
//! THREAD SAFETY: This tally system interacts closely with pointers to blocks
//! in the chain index. Always lock cs_main before calling its methods.
