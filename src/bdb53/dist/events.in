# There are two kinds of entries in events.in, describing either an event class
# or an individual event. The entries starting in the first column are class
# names, consisting of a single word. The class's individual events follow,
# described as if they were an ANSI C function signature;
#
# Events are listed grouped by their relation to one another, rather than
# alphabetically. For instance allocation and free events are adjacent.
# New, unrelated events are placed at the end of their event class.
