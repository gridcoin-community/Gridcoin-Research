//! \brief Links an account on the BOINC platform with a participant in the
//! Gridcoin research reward protocol.
//!
//! The Gridcoin cryptocurrency technology rewards computing work executed for
//! research projects on the BOINC distributed computing platform. As a system
//! separate from BOINC, the Gridcoin network must regularly synchronize state
//! with the supported BOINC projects. The network employs several specialized
//! protocols, collectively known as the researcher reward protocol, that turn
//! recorded quantities of computational work into values of Gridcoin currency
//! by translating data collected from BOINC project servers.
//!
//! This protocol must map BOINC accounts to addresses in the Gridcoin block
//! chain to allocate and distribute rewards as GRC proportional to the work
//! completed by computers operated by the participants in the network. This
//! process depends on beacons submitted to the block chain to establish the
//! relationships between BOINC users and their wallet's cryptographic keys.
//!
//! A node in the network must advertise a beacon to initiate a process which
//! eventually demonstrates the node's eligibility to generate rewards earned
//! for BOINC computation. The action formally broadcasts a node's claim to a
//! BOINC identity by producing a transaction that includes the node's public
//! key and the external cross-project identifier (CPID) of the BOINC user to
//! associate with the key.
//!
//! This class contains the beacon data submitted to the network as a contract
//! message embedded in a transaction. A node validates a generated block that
//! claims a research reward by verifying the signature in the block using the
//! public key contained in the beacon that matches the block CPID.
