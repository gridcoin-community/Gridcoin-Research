     * The algorithm below is an attempt to come up with a more accurate way of estimating Time to Stake (ETTS) based on

     * the cooldown period is 16 hours, and depending on how many UTXO's and where they are with respect to getting out of
     * cooldown has a lot to do with the expected time to stake.
     *
     * The way to conceptualize the approach below is to think of the UTXO's as bars on a Gantt Chart. It is a negative Gantt
     * chart, meaning that each UTXO bar is cooldown period long, and while the current time is in that bar, the staking probability
     * for the UTXO is zero, and UnitStakingProbability elsewhere. A timestamp mask of 16x the normal mask is used to reduce
     * the work in the nested loop, so that a 16 hour interval will have a maximum of 225 events, and most likely far less.
     * This is important, because the inner loop will be the number of UTXO's. A future improvement to this algorithm would
     * also be to quantize (group) the UTXO's themselves (the Gantt bars) so that the work would be further reduced.
     * You will see that once the UTXO's are sorted in ascending order based on the time of the end of each of their cooldowns, this
     * becomes a manageable algorithm to piece the probabilities together.
     *
     * You will note that the compound Poisson (geometric) recursive probability relation is used, since you cannot simply add
     * the probabilities due to consideration of high confidence (CDF) values of 80% or more.
     *
     * Thin local data structures are used to hold the UTXO information. This minimizes the amount of time
     * that locks on the wallet need to be held at the expense of a little memory consumption.
