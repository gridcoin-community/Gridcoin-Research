//! \brief Records proof-of-stake claims for spam protection.
//!
//! This type provides support for spam mitigation at the chain tip by tracking
//! the staking kernel proofs used to generate a new block. Nodes reject blocks
//! with staked inputs spent for another block to prevent a malicious or broken
//! node from spamming multiple blocks that compete for the best chain.
//!
//! This problem is a characteristic of proof-of-stake consensus protocols. The
//! outputs used to create the kernel proof have no practical link to the block
//! generated for that stake. If they did, the protocol would incentivize block
//! producers to manipulate new blocks to synthesize suitable proofs--a process
//! that looks a lot like proof-of-work consensus.
//!
//! Because a particular block does not depend on the properties of a stake, an
//! actor can theoretically produce an unlimited set of blocks from an eligible
//! proof and submit all of those blocks as candidates for next in the chain to
//! flood the network and disrupt consensus. By disallowing nodes to generate a
//! block with the same proof as another near the chain tip, we can depress the
//! threat posed by this type of attack.
//!
//! This class replaces the original \c setStakeSeen sets to relieve the memory
//! pressure from the block index. For now, a node will use it to reproduce the
//! original behavior, but we may want to revisit spam mitigation techniques in
//! the future.
