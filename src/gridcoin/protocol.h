//! \brief Enumeration of protocol status. Unlike beacons this is for both storage
//! and memory.
//!
//! UNKNOWN status is only encountered in trivially constructed empty
//! protocol entries and should never be seen on the blockchain.
//!
//! DELETED status corresponds to the functionality implemented in the AppCacheEntryExt
//! structure in the protocol to compensate for the lack of presence of a deleted record
//! in the old appcache. Rather than removing a record when a REMOVE contract is
//! encountered, The existing record is linked to the new one, which will have a
//! DELETED status.
//!
//! ACTIVE corresponds to an active entry.
//!
//! OUT_OF_BOUND must go at the end and be retained for the EnumBytes wrapper.

//!
//! \brief This class formalizes the concept of an authorized protocol entry and replaces
//! the older appcache "protocol" section. For protocol entries, the "key" field is a string.
//! The datetime of the transaction containing the contract that gives rise to the entry is
//! stored as m_timestamp. The hash of the transaction is stored as m_hash. m_previous_hash
//! stores the transaction hash of a previous protocol entry with the same key, if there is
//! one. This has the effect of creating "chainlets", or a one-way linked list by hash of
//! protocol entries with the same key. This becomes very important to support reversion and
//! avoid expensive forward contract replays during a blockchain reorganization event. The
//! status of the protocol entry is stored as m_status in accordance with the class enum above.
