//!
//! \brief Enumeration of scraper status. Unlike beacons this is for both storage
//! and memory.
//!
//! UNKNOWN status is only encountered in trivially constructed empty
//! scraper entries and should never be seen on the blockchain.
//!
//! DELETED status corresponds to the functionality implemented in the AppCacheEntryExt
//! structure in the scraper to compensate for the lack of presence of a deleted record
//! in the old appcache. Rather than removing a record when a REMOVE contract is
//! encountered, The existing record is linked to the new one, which will have a
//! DELETED status.
//!
//! NOT_AUTHORIZED corresponds to the old appcache scraper section "false" value.
//!
//! AUTHORIZED corresponds to the old appcache scraper section "true" value
//!
//! EXPLORER is a new status that is meant to be able to establish differentiated
//! permission between a normal scraper node and one that is authorized to download
//! and retain all project stats files and store for an extended period. For legacy
//! purposes, this translates to "true' in the old appcache scraper section as well. Once
//! the scraper code has been converted over to use the native calls here from the
//! compatibility shims, then this new status can be used to specifically control
//! which scrapers are allowed to do extended explorer style statistics download and
//! retention.
//!
//! OUT_OF_BOUND must go at the end and be retained for the EnumBytes wrapper.
//!

//!
//! \brief This class formalizes the concept of an authorized scraper entry and replaces
//! the older appcache "scraper" section. Scrapers are authorized by their address, i.e.
//! CKeyID (since the other modes in CTxDestination do not apply). So the "key" field in
//! the ScraperEntry is m_key of type CKeyID. The datetime of the transaction containing
//! the contract that gives rise to the Entry is stored as m_timestamp. The hash of the
//! transaction is stored as m_hash. m_previous_hash stores the transaction hash of a previous
//! scraper entry with the same CKeyID, if there is one. This has the effect of creating
//! "chainlets", or a one-way linked list by hash of scraper entries with the same key.
//! This becomes very important to support reversion and avoid expensive forward contract
//! replays during a blockchain reorganization event. The status of the scraper entry
//! is stored as m_status in accordance with the class enum above.
